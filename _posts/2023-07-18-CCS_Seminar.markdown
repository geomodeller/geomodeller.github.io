| Seminar Presented by Dr. Seok-ki Moon |

Hello everyone,

We are thrilled to share with you the electrifying experience we had at the seminar presented by Dr. Seok-ki Moon. The event was graced by undergraduate/graduate students from the Enenrgy Resources Engineering and Mechanical Engineering departments to witness the unveiling of an ingenious solution - the Zero-Emission Underwater Power Station, fondly known as [**ZEUS**](https://www.upstreamonline.com/focus/zeus-to-take-gas-to-power-technology-to-poseidons-realm/2-1-1201911).

üåü Who is Dr. Moon?

Dr. Seok-ki Moon, a leading figure in subsea process system engineering, is currently working for Aker Solutions in Norway to tackle the global challenge of climate change. As the keynote speaker of the day, Dr. Moon held us all in awe as he took the stage to introduce his most ambitious project to date - ZEUS.

üåä The Concept of ZEUS

> The magic behind the Zeus project ‚Äî for "zero-emissions underwater power station" ‚Äî is that it all happens on the seabed, says Rune Vesterkjaer, Aker Solutions‚Äô vice president for production, compression, power and pumps. 
> ‚ÄúIf you look at what the concept of Zeus is, it‚Äôs to produce gas, to produce power without emitting anything. We‚Äôre basically doing instant carbon capture," he tells Upstream. 
> ‚ÄúWe are getting CO2 and water out of the combustion process on the seabed that we can directly inject for storage. We can use it for EOR [enhanced oil recovery] but storage is the base case.‚Äù \
> ... from [**ZEUS**](https://www.upstreamonline.com/focus/zeus-to-take-gas-to-power-technology-to-poseidons-realm/2-1-1201911)

At its core, ZEUS aims to generate clean and sustainable electricity in the subsea environment, setting itself apart from traditional energy sources that contribute to harmful emissions. By harnessing the power of the underwater realm, ZEUS presents an innovative approach to geoenergy, promising a cleaner and greener future for all.


üî¨ How Does ZEUS Work?

Dr. Moon expounded on the conceptual mechanisms behind ZEUS. This pioneering underwater power station consists of massive turbines strategically positioned at key locations beneath the ocean's surface. Additionally, an ingeniously integrated air separation unit directly supplies oxygen to the subsea plant, facilitating the generation of highly concentrated CO2 after combustion. The resulting CO2 is subsequently connected to a carbon capture system, allowing for smooth injection of CO2 into the subsurface.


üëè Applause and Enthusiasm

The audience responded with thunderous applause and genuine enthusiasm for this groundbreaking project. Dr. Moon's vision and dedication at Aker Solutions to combating climate change through sustainable energy solutions left an indelible mark on all attendees.
