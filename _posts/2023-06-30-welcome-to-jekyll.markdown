| My Farewell to BP: A Remarkable Journey of Broadening Perspectives |

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Energy Resources Engineering Department](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/eng/3590/subview.do?&enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGZGVwYXJ0bWVudEludHJvJTJGZW5nJTJGNjMlMkYxNzclMkZjb2xsZWdlUHJvZkxpc3QuZG8lM0ZmbGFnJTNEJTI2) at [Inha University](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/eng/index.do), specializing in subsurface modeling, reservoir simulation, and machine learning applications in earth sciences. My research interests have been influenced by my Ph.D. supervisor, [Dr. Michael Pyrcz](https://michaelpyrcz.com/my-story), leading me to delve into the fascinating field of subsurface modelling (with two Ls). Currently, my focus lies in the area of CO2 geological storage.

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D. at UT Austin, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at Seoul National University under the guidance of Dr. Jonggeun Choe. With over 11 years of experience in petroleum and geosystems engineering, I strongly believe that subsurface technology plays a pivotal role in facilitating a seamless energy transition and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Furthermore, the Fourth (or Fifth in short) Industrial Revolution emphasizes the significance of a multidisciplinary approach. Therefore, my research group and I are dedicated to leveraging AI for subsurface technologies.

I invite you to explore our recent repositories, which cover [subsurface modelling using AI techniques](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos/blob/master/SubsurfaceDataAnalytics_ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks.ipynb) and [Python-based geostatistics derived from Dr. Pyrcz's work](https://github.com/geomodeller/KSMER_GeostatsDemo). If you would like to learn more about our research or explore opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to contact me through any of the channels listed below. I look forward to engaging with you.

Best,
Honggeun
