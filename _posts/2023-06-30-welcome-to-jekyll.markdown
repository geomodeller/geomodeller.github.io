![MyPhoto](./last_day_in_BP.jpg)  

I am an assistant professor at [Inha University](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/eng/3590/subview.do?&enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGZGVwYXJ0bWVudEludHJvJTJGZW5nJTJGNjMlMkYxNzclMkZjb2xsZWdlUHJvZkxpc3QuZG8lM0ZmbGFnJTNEJTI2)

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')

{% endhighlight %}
