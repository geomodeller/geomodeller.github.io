## Project CO2-VLP
We are currently dedicated to developing a Python-based Equation of State (EOS) for CO2 that considers different temperature and pressure conditions, encompassing gas, liquid, and supercritical phases. Our ultimate goal is to create a vertical lift performance (VLP) for CO2 injection in subsurface environments, accommodating any surface conditions of CO2. By integrating this system with CO2 transportation and subsurface simulation, we aim to facilitate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) projects.

## Project CO2-Subsurface Modelling
Our primary focus revolves around the development of a geostatistical modeling workflow, utilizing both GSLIB and Python (supplemented with [Geostatspy by Dr. Pyrcz](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy)), with a specific emphasis on characterizing CO2 storage. In our research, we will explore both Kriging-based and Multi-point statistics methods, carefully evaluating the resulting uncertainty in the subsurface. Subsequently, we will utilize subsurface flow simulation, such as [MRST](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/), to estimate the development of the CO2 plume.
